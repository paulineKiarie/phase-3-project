# phase-3-project

Business overview
Syriatel is a telecommunication company based in Syria that is looking to reduce customer churning inorder to increase their revenue.The company asssigned us  with the role of  building a classifier whose main goal is to predict customer churn in order help the telecom company to retain valuable customers, reduce revenue loss, and improve customer satisfaction. This can ultimately lead to increased revenue and profitability for the company.


Business problem
Churn prediction is a technique used by companies to identify customers who are most likely to stop using their products or services.By using the dataset provided we are going to be exploring the features provided in order to create a classifier that can predict the likelihood of a customer churning and also the factors that lead to high customer churning.with creation of an effective model Syriatel will be able to identify their weaknesses and how to improve inorder to be able to maintain their customers and reduce customers leaving.


Objectives
1.our main objective is to identify the features that lead to high customer churning and to what extent
2.To create predictive,supervised models that can predict churn
3.To identify ways in which we can reduce customer churning by comparing with features causing it.e.g they can improve their customer service calls


Data understanding
inorder to create our model,we used Syria dataset from kaggle to create our our model.The dataset has 3333rows and 21 columns.We identified features that were affecting customer behaviour in the company.features such as customer service,international calls and total day charges.There were no duplicated or missing values in the dataset.I used churn as the target column to predict customers leaving and those remaining in the company.We also dropped some features such as state and areacode since they were not useful in our models.


Visualisations


Modelling
We used 4 models to predict the level of churning in our company.The baseline model,KNN Model,DecisionTree model,Randomforest.
